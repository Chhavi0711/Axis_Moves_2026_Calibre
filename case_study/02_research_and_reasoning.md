# 02 - Research and Reasoning

## Grounding in the Bank's own framing

The brief pointed teams toward Axis Bank's public disclosures to identify real
strategic bets rather than inventing a problem in the abstract. We used that lens to
test whether "decision authority tied to title" was a genuine friction point rather
than a convenient story - it recurs wherever an organization has layered sign-off
processes for risk-bearing decisions (lending, credit, underwriting), which made it a
credible, bank-wide lever rather than a narrow, single-department fix.

## Alternatives we considered and ruled out

We deliberately screened out directions the brief warned against, and a few others that
looked appealing on the surface but didn't hold up:

- **A pure AI-underwriting or AI-approval idea.** The brief explicitly excludes
  technology-only solutions without an operating-model change, and AI directly
  *approving* credit decisions would also raise the exact regulatory and accountability
  problems we wanted to avoid. We kept AI in a recommend-and-route role, never an
  approval role.
- **An automation/efficiency play on existing approval workflows.** Speeding up the
  current ladder (e.g., faster routing software, tighter SLAs) would still leave
  authority fixed by title - it treats the symptom (slow approvals) without touching the
  actual cause (routing is blind to who is best-placed to decide).
- **A narrow, single-function fix** (e.g., just SME lending, permanently). We used SME
  lending as the pilot *entry point* because it is a contained, measurable environment -
  but we designed the underlying mechanism (Calibre scoring + AI matching) to be
  portable across risk-bearing decision types from the start, so the idea scales rather
  than staying a point solution.
- **A performance-review or appraisal redesign.** Calibre tracks decision outcomes to
  route *future* cases, not to score employees for compensation or promotion purposes.
  We were careful to keep this distinct from a talent-management or HR initiative,
  because conflating the two would create exactly the gaming and morale risks we wanted
  to design against.

## Why "earned authority" beats "faster approval"

The core reframe we landed on: **the organization already had the right answer early in
Anjali's case.** The twelve days weren't spent deliberating - they were spent moving the
same answer through layers that didn't need to weigh in. That reframing is what pointed
us toward a *routing* solution (get the case to the right judgment faster) rather than a
*speed* solution (make every layer move faster).

## Why governance had to stay untouched

Given this is a regulated lending environment, any solution that changed who has
*ultimate* sanctioning authority, or removed a check the RBI framework requires, would
fail on both compliance and jury credibility grounds. We treated "operate entirely
inside the existing sanctioning grid" as a hard constraint from the start, not an
afterthought - which is why AI's role is capped at recommend-and-route, and why the
pilot design explicitly proposes a **dual-run against the existing grid** rather than a
replacement of it on day one.
